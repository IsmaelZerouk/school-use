Something that i have notived on my recomendation list is that the Starring and title list both have the same recommendations and the same treshold, eventhough the parameters are different. 

Also in the title recommendation part you would guess that it would also show the other batman titles higher up but the first recomendation is untill line 17, 
while i do say that it should look for titles that contain batman. 

As for recommendations based on summary it says that the best movie that i should watch is good night and good luck but you would guess that it would be another batman movie that was
something that i didnt expect. 

All in all i think that the recommendation does work good and properly.
